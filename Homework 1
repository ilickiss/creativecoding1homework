CLI and GUI are two different "looks" of coding. GUI looks similar to using photo shop to me. There are many different menus and buttons to interact with the code. CLI is reminiscent of Minecraft- my first and only experience mimicking the action of coding.

GUI tends to be more user friendly because it is made of many preset buttons, menus, it is often seen as easier to understand. Because it relies on these presets, it takes more resources. It looks visually easy to understand. It makes programs easy to operate and looks visually clean for a novice computer user.

CLI is completely text and command based. The command line can be confusing to understand, so it can be intimidating to new computer users. Once understood the command line is clean and consistent looking even between different projects. CLI has its own special syntaxes and terminology that are not always intuitive. Once command line is understood, you will have a more specific and faster ability to code and create. You are able to have much more specific control over projects with CLI. CLI is fast, consumes less energy, and has more compatibility. The command line does not change and lose function with updates, which increases its durability as a project.
