PROPOSAL - PHANEROZOIC JUMP
---------------------------
For my final project, I will attempt to make the best doodle jump game possible.
I would like to make a game that helps the player memorize the eras, and possibly periods of time in history.

I would like to begin the game with a menu, that includes text explaining the phanerozoic eon.
Your goal as the player will be to increase in time until you win by making it to the modern holocene.
I would like to include text that reflects the current time peroid with the player's increased placement on the Y axis.

My Goals:
-Creating a functional Jumping game!
- Having it count you elevation, and categorize it into the 3 Eras of rhe Phanerozoic Eon.
- a menu and restart option
- Unique educational Background and sprite images.
- relaxing audio file that plays when you begin the game
- minimal and but tasteful design.
- text that tells the player what era they are within and reminds them of that era's time period

I would like to include:
- a background image that changes as you increase in Y axis to the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic time periods. I may be unable to complete this but I want to.

I do not want to include enemies, just a simple, relaxing jumping mechanic. The idea is that by repeatedly winning, it helps you memorize the eras like levels.

INSPIRATIONS
------------
My inspiration for this project is the simplicity of doodle jump, but also the time map of eons that scientists have put together to help us conceptualize such a large amount of time.
I think my main way to solve problems here will be to remain flexible, and lower my expectations

MY WORRIES AND ISSUES
---------------------
I understand my skill level in this course. I am really struggling to keep up and will likely have to retake this course. 
But, I want to give this the best effort I can! I think this simple idea will still be able to combine my interests into a final project I am proud of.

I think I will have a lot of problems uploading a background image. I hope to look up tutorials, but have also scheduled a meeting to ask for help and extra resources.
I am leaning heavily on doodle jump game related p5.js youtube tutorials by TechHeadOnline, and Kaelinator.

I have been absolutely swamped with my personal life and taking too many classes this semester, and have reached out to professional help on these fronts.
However, my time is going to be a huge difficulty! I will do my best to let go of perfectionism and get something turned in without making myself sick. 

WORK PLAN
---------
Holy cow have I overcommitted myself this semester. Lessons learned, trying my best to swim through my first semester back after a good 7 years. My ambition sure got the best of me!
I have finished my researching and come up with my idea this week, and completed the bulk of the work I've needed to on my other final projects to be able to commit time to this project!
I have inverted my sleep schedule to improve focus. I hope to have a bulk of the work done by thursday, so I can ask for help on Friday if needed.

Though i have only been able to commit to working this week, I have completed almost all of the homework in 1 day. By that logic, 3 days of work is equivalent. I will spend approximately 72 manic hours total on this project.
Its time for a game Jam!

Tuesday- menu and base of game completed.
Wednesday - incorporate images and audio
Thursday - I will have found enough issues to deal with by then
Friday - Problemsolving with professionals
Saturday - Final polishing/inevitably go to the crisis center again
Sunday - Submit and leave to start my work season.
